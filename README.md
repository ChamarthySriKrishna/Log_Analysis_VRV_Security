# Log_Analysis_VRV_Security
Python script for Log Analysis as per the assignment instructions given by VRV Security. This repository is created to complete the assignment given by VRV Security i.e., Python Script to perform Log Analysis on a example log file i.e., sample.log file.

Follow the below steps to follow to execute the log_analysis.py file:
1. Paste the script in an IDE or Python Notebook (Google Colaboratory in my case).
2. Download the sample.log file to use as an example log file to run and test the script. Change the file path in the script as necessary. (I have created a sample.log file in file contents tab in Google Colaboratory and specified its file path).
3. Now run the log_analysis.py script and observe the results in the both the terminal and a copy of the output will be generated as a CSV file (log_analysis_results.csv).
